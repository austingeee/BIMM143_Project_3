# BIMM143_Project_3

This is Austin Gomez's submission for BIMM143 Project 3.

To use the code, two things are needed:

1) The Jupyter notebook
2) The 6 Different Text Files containing protein sequecnes for CK1D (uploaded to reposiory). 
    -Homo_Sapiens_Seq.txt
    -Fruit_Bat_Seq.txt
    -Clawed_Frog_Seq.txt
    -House_Mice_seq.txt
    -Zebra_Fish_Seq.txt
    -Clawed_Frog_Seq.txt
    
    Information for where these sequecnes were taken from: 
    
    Protein sequneces for CK1D were collected for multible organisms: Humans, Fruit Bats, Zebrefish, House Mouse, Chimpanzees, and Clawed Frogs. A pairwise alignment method was used to compare each of the organisms aino acid sequences, using Humans as a reference for all comparisons. The sequences used for the alignment were found on the National Center for Biotehnology Information (NCBI, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The sequences were saved indivisually as .txt files to be read in the actual code.
